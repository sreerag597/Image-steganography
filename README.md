# Image-steganography
A simple and efficient implementation of image steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. This project hides and retrieves secret data inside BMP images by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values. Includes full encoding and decoding modules with validation, error handling, and support for secret file extensions.
